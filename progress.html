// SCALING OPTIONS
// scaling can have values as follows with full being the default
// "fit"    sets canvas and stage to dimensions and scales to fit inside window size
// "outside"    sets canvas and stage to dimensions and scales to fit outside window size
// "full"    sets stage to window size with no scaling
// "tagID"    add canvas to HTML tag of ID - set to dimensions if provided - no scaling

var scaling = "fit"; // this will resize to fit inside the screen dimensions
var width = 1024;
var height = 768;
var color = light;
var outerColor = darker;
var assets = ["01 Hallogallo.wma"];
var path = "assets/";
// var waiter = new Waiter({backgroundColor:yellow, corner:0});
var progress = new ProgressBar({barType:"rectangle"});

// as of ZIM 5.5.0 you do not need to put zim before ZIM functions and classes
var frame = new Frame(scaling, width, height, color, outerColor, assets, path, progress);
frame.on("ready", function() {
    zog("ready from ZIM Frame"); // logs in console (F12 - choose console)

    var stage = frame.stage;
    var stageW = frame.width;
    var stageH = frame.height;

    asset("01 Hallogallo.wma").play();


    stage.update(); // this is needed to show any changes

}); // end of ready
